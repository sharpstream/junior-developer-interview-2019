## Task Description

### Describe Your Approach

In the `task-approach.md` file, describe how you would retrieve the following pieces of information from the `stations.json` file.

- Get the total number of stations
- Get the total number of station groups
- Get the total people currently listening across all stations
- Get the station with the longest average listening duration
- Get the station with the highest peak listeners
- Get the amount of stations with 500 current listeners or more
- Get the amount of stations with 200 current listeners or more
- Get the amount of stations with 300 current listeners or less
- Get the country with the highest current listeners
- Get the country with the highest peak listeners
- Get the Amount of stations in Great Britain with 500 current listeners or more

### Find the answers

Now using php in the index.php file load the data from `stations.json` and calculate the answers to each
of the above.

By running `php index.php` in the command line there should be an output that looks like this : 

```php
Total Number of Stations : xxx
Total Number of Station Groups : xxx
Total current listeners across all stations : xxx
The station with the longest listener duration is : xxx

There are xxx stations with 300 listeners or less
The country with the most current listeners is xx 
The country with the highest peak listeners is xx
Stations in Great Britain with 500 current listners or more : xxx, xxx, xxx
```

### Bonus Points

- Get the station with the highest peak listeners in Great Britain
- List the station group(s) with the most stations
